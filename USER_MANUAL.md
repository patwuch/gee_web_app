## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum version | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Docker Engine | 24+ | Includes `docker compose` plugin |
| Docker Compose | v2 | Called as `docker compose` (no hyphen) |
| Disk space | ~5 GB free | Per run; varies with AOI size and date range |
| GEE service account | — | JSON key file; see §3 |

On **macOS/Windows** use Docker Desktop. On **Linux** install Docker Engine and the Compose plugin from the official packages.

Verify your install:

```bash
docker --version        # Docker version 24.x or later
docker compose version  # Docker Compose version v2.x or later
```

---

## 2. Getting the code

Clone the repository and enter the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/gee_web_app.git
cd gee_web_app
```

If you received the code as a ZIP archive instead, unzip it and `cd` into the resulting folder. The rest of the steps are identical.

Make the launcher script executable:

```bash
chmod +x quickstart.sh
```

**What you'll see inside the folder:**

```
gee_web_app/
├── main.py               ← Streamlit application (UI + pipeline launcher)
├── Snakefile_parquet     ← Snakemake workflow (GeoParquet pipeline)
├── scripts/              ← Worker scripts called by Snakemake
├── config/               ← Key stored here after first-run setup (see §3)
├── data/                 ← Created automatically; holds all run data
├── Start.command         ← Launcher for macOS (double-click)
├── Start.bat             ← Launcher for Windows (double-click)
├── Stop.command          ← Stop the app on macOS (double-click)

├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt
```

## 3. GEE credentials

The app connects to Google Earth Engine using a **service account key**. You set this up entirely inside the browser — no manual file copying required.

**Getting a key from Google Cloud:**

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and select your project.
2. Create (or open) a service account that has the **Earth Engine** role.
3. Go to **Keys → Add Key → Create new key → JSON** and download the file.

**Uploading the key in the app:**

The first time you open `http://localhost:8501`, the app shows a setup screen instead of the normal UI. Drag-and-drop (or click to browse) the downloaded `.json` file into the upload widget. The app validates it and confirms the service-account email — then loads the full interface automatically.

The key is saved to `config/gee-key.json` on the host and reused on every subsequent restart. You will not be prompted again unless you remove it.

**Removing or replacing the key:**

Open the **GEE credentials** expander in the left sidebar and click **Remove / replace key**. The setup screen reappears so you can upload a different key.

> `config/gee-key.json` is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to git.

---

## 4. Building and launching Docker

**macOS** — double-click `Start.command` in Finder.

**Windows** — double-click `Start.bat`.

**Linux** — run `./quickstart.sh` from a terminal inside the project folder.

All three do the same thing:

1. Check that Docker Desktop is running and show a clear message if it isn't.
2. Build the image on first launch (downloads base image and installs dependencies — **takes 3–10 minutes the first time**, cached for every launch after).
3. Start the container, pick the first free port from 8501–8505, wait for the UI to respond, then open it in your browser automatically.

> **macOS — first launch only:** If you see "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified", right-click `Start.command` and choose **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog. You won't be asked again.

**To stop the app** when you are done:

- **macOS:** double-click `Stop.command`
- **Windows:** double-click `Stop.bat`
- **Linux:** run `./stop.sh` in a terminal

**To follow live logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

## 5. Using the downloader (Streamlit UI)

The UI is divided into numbered sections. Work through them top-to-bottom for a new run.

---

### Section 0 — Run Session (sidebar)

Located at the top of the left sidebar.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **RUN ID** (text box) | Leave blank to auto-generate a 6-character ID for a new run. Type an existing ID to resume or monitor a previous run. |

When you type an existing RUN ID, a status badge (`running`, `completed`, `failed`) appears below the input. If the run is still active, a **Stop This RUN ID** button is also shown.

The **Local RUN registry** expander beneath shows a table of every run ever started, with status and timestamps. Click any row in the **Inspect a stored RUN** selector to see its full configuration.

---

### Section 1 — Data Parameters (sidebar)

Each dataset is collapsed inside its own expander. Expand one or more to configure them.

**Available datasets:**

| Dataset | What it measures | Native resolution | Date range |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **CHIRPS** | Precipitation | 0.05° (~5.6 km) | 1981-01 → present |
| **ERA5_LAND** | Temperature, precipitation, evaporation (11 variables) | ~9 km | 1950-01 → present |
| **MODIS_LST** | Land Surface Temperature (day + night) | 1 km | 2000-02 → present |
| **MODIS_NDVI_EVI** | Vegetation indices | 250 m | 2000-02 → present |
| **WorldCover_v100** | Land cover classification 2020 | 10 m | 2020 only |
| **WorldCover_v200** | Land cover classification 2021 | 10 m | 2021 only |
| **MODIS_LULC** | Land cover types | 500 m | 2001–2023 |

**For each dataset you enable:**

1. Tick **Enable `<dataset>`**.
2. **Select Bands** — choose which variables to extract (all are ticked by default).
3. **Select Statistics (Reducers)** — `mean`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `median`. The default is pre-filled per dataset.
4. **Select date range** — Products with composite cadence will automatically extract data within the selected range.

You can enable multiple datasets in one run; they are processed in parallel subject to GEE rate limits.

---

### Section 2 — Area of Interest

This is the left main column, labelled **2. Area of Interest**.

#### Uploading your geometry

Click **Browse files** and upload one of:

| Format | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **ZIP shapefile** | Must contain `.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj` together in one ZIP |
| **GeoJSON** | Single `.geojson` file |
| **GeoParquet** | `.parquet` or `.geoparquet` with a geometry column |

The app validates the geometry and stores it inside the run directory at `data/runs/<run_id>/inputs/`, keeping all inputs and outputs together in one place.

#### New run vs. resume

- Leave **RUN ID** blank in Section 0 to start fresh.
- Enter an existing RUN ID to resume — the geometry is already stored with that run, so no re-upload is needed.

#### Running the pipeline

Once at least one dataset is configured and the AOI is uploaded, the **Run Analysis** button becomes active. Click it to:

1. Freeze the run configuration.
2. Auto-generate or reuse the RUN ID.
3. Show an **Execution Plan** with job counts.
4. Launch Snakemake in the background.

Progress is shown below as chunk and final-file counts update. You can safely navigate away and come back — the pipeline runs in the background inside the container.

---

### Section 3 — Results

Located in the right main column, labelled **3. Results**.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Results RUN ID** (text box) | Filter downloads to one specific run. Leave blank to show all runs. |

When results are available, download buttons appear for each output file:

- **GeoParquet (recommended)** — column-compressed, geometry-preserving, cloud-native format. One file per product per run.
- **Legacy CSV** — flat table without geometry.

File naming convention:

```
<product>_<start_date>_to_<end_date>.parquet
# e.g. CHIRPS_1986-01-01_to_2026-02-28.parquet
```

Click the download button to save the file to your machine.

---

### Section 4 — Partial Checkout

Appears when a Results RUN ID is entered. Useful when a long run is still in progress and you need intermediate results.

1. Click **Prepare/Refresh Partial Checkout Files**.
2. The app merges all completed chunk files (even if the full pipeline hasn't finished) into a single GeoParquet per product.
3. Download buttons appear for the merged partial files.

Re-click the button at any time to include newer completed chunks.

---

## 6. Stopping, resuming, and housekeeping

### Stopping a running pipeline

- **From the UI:** Enter the RUN ID in Section 0 → click **Stop This RUN ID**.
- **From the terminal:** `docker compose exec app kill -TERM <snakemake_pid>` (PID shown in the sidebar).
- **Nuclear option:** `docker compose down` — stops everything; you can restart and resume.

### Resuming a failed or stopped run

1. Enter the RUN ID in the Section 0 sidebar input.
2. Configure the same products and date range.
3. Click **Run Analysis** — the stored geometry is reused automatically and Snakemake picks up from where it left off (only missing chunks are re-extracted).

### Unlocking a stale Snakemake lock

If the app crashed mid-run, Snakemake may leave a `.snakemake/locks/` directory inside the run folder. The app automatically attempts an unlock before each new run. If problems persist, run the unlock command for the specific run:

```bash
docker compose exec app bash -c "cd /app/data/runs/<run_id> && snakemake --unlock --snakefile /app/Snakefile_parquet --directory /app/data/runs/<run_id>"
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| UI never loads after `quickstart.sh` | Port 8501 blocked or image build failed | `docker compose logs -f app` to inspect |
| "GEE authentication error" | `gee-key.json` missing or wrong path | Confirm file is at `config/gee-key.json` |
| Pipeline hangs at 0 chunks | GEE rate limit or network issue | Wait 2 min; check `data/runs/<run_id>/logs/snakemake_run.log` |
| Run shows `failed` immediately | Snakemake lock from a prior crash | Run the unlock command above, then retry |
| File ownership issues on Linux | UID/GID mismatch | `./quickstart.sh` fixes this automatically by exporting `HOST_UID`/`HOST_GID` |

**Log locations:**

| Log | Path |
|-----|------|
| Snakemake run log | `data/runs/<run_id>/logs/snakemake_run.log` |
| Container stdout | `docker compose logs app` |
| Run event history | `data/runs/run_state.duckdb` → `run_events` table |

```

### Live container logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
```

### Open a shell inside the container

```bash
docker compose exec app bash
```

### Port selection

`quickstart.sh` tries ports 8501–8505 and uses the first one that is free. To change the candidate list, edit the `PORTS` array at the top of `quickstart.sh`.

### File ownership on Linux

`quickstart.sh` exports `HOST_UID` and `HOST_GID` before starting the container so that files written inside the container are owned by your host user. If you start the container manually (e.g. `docker compose up -d`), export those variables first:

```bash
export HOST_UID=$(id -u) HOST_GID=$(id -g)
docker compose up -d app
```
